# don't touch this file unless you want to add some aliases for converters.
# if you are a developer, you can add your own converter with aliases to here then use /convert <some alias>
# you should make a converter first, of course.
# your converter should implement SST's Converter interface and must have a constructor with SST parameter.
# use - instead of .
