# SimpleServerToolsBasic server tools plugin for Spigot/Paper 1.8.8-1.16.5.## RequirementsSST works all the versions from 1.8.8 (tested on Paper and GreenMC's NachoFork) to 1.16.5 Paper (not tested but should work).  Some features requires ProtocolLib. The reason of this is, 1.8.8 Spigot (or Paper) API isn't enough for managing client-side server list menu.## DocumentationDocumentation will be ready soon.## CompilingSST uses Maven for compilation.  Clone the repo using ``git clone https://github.com/bilektugrul/SimpleServerTools.git`` or get source code from GitHub.Go to the source directory and use ``mvn clean package`` for getting the .jar file.   We recommend IntelliJ IDEA.## DownloadWe use master branch for stable commits, so you can download the latest version from last GitHub Actions run. ## Contact with DevelopersBreakthrough's discord: Breakthrough#1006
